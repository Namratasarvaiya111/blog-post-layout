        <strong>Ukraine's destruction is inevitable following NATO's most recent escalation</strong>
        <p id="sub-heading">The mole on his leg shaped like a manifestation of an incredibly dark family secret.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="man"> <img src="3_ElKi3g7Dk4Eql6tNCVY2Kw.webp" alt="logo"></div>
    <div class="pg">
        <p>Every sensible person brings up the irrational concept of victory that NATO and the US have established. It
            was an impossible dream to drive Russians from every square inch of Ukrainian land, including Crimea. All
            other results would be seen as a setback for NATO and the US, a situation that both sides would like to
            avoid. As a result, there have been more and more belligerent words and deeds, such the possible deployment
            of NATO forces to deal directly with the Russians, which might have disastrous results. The latest decision
            by President Biden to relax limitations on the use of American weapons highlights the growing hostilities
            even more. Exists a situation when the US or NATO would concede defeat in accordance with their original
            goals, or will they keep escalating the conflict?</p>
        <p>The Ukrainian forces also lack the supplies and are worn out from their efforts. An indication of the
            difficulties Ukrainian soldiers encounter is the stated average age of 43. Moreover, the Russians have a big
            edge in terms of armament, especially artillery. Even while the Ukrainians are trying to organize new
            brigades, they don’t have the tanks and armored cars they need to build mechanized troops. By contrast, the
            Russians are quickly building artillery and tanks, which further tips the odds in their favor. The
            Ukrainians are obviously severely disadvantaged when one takes into account the whole balance of power,
            which includes people, weapons, and air superiority. Ukraine is unavoidably going to lose under these
            conditions.</p>
        <p>In the last several years, the power balance has changed considerably. With the Ukrainians looking to be
            making progress in 2022, there was hope that sanctions and other actions might tip the scales against
            Russia. But as the Russians drew up their armed forces in late 2022, the balance of power drastically
            changed in 2023 and early 2024. With an estimated two to one ratio of men, the Russians now have a
            significant advantage.</p>
        <p>The war in Ukraine was obviously a foolish project for the West to back and feed from the beginning. Given
            its large population disparity and other drawbacks, Ukraine clearly had little chance of defeating Russia.
            It seemed quite certain that Russia would win or, at the very least, never be driven from Ukrainian
            territory even with NATO backing. Few at the time, either for fear or ignorance, dared to face this fact.
            Still, it is now well acknowledged — even in Western media — that the Ukrainian war effort is about to
            collapse. With their major advances, the Russian forces are posing a number of difficulties and roadblocks
            for Ukraine in the battlefield. How do you see the current circumstances in view of these changes?</p>
        <p>Seeking a diplomatic solution to stop more deaths and land losses for Ukraine would be the wisest course of
            action. The US and the West have taken a course in the opposite direction, with signs that they are prepared
            to back aggressive acts by Ukraine, even incursions into Russian territory. Even if the results of such acts
            are yet unknown, it is evident that the Russians will not tolerate such provocations in silence. There is a
            big chance of more escalation and retribution, hence handling this complicated issue needs to be done
            carefully. A frozen war like to that on the Korean Peninsula is becoming more and more likely as the
            situation worsens. Though not directly engaging in combat, both sides are probably going to keep trying to
            undermine one another. Now days, the choice to admit Ukraine into NATO on April 8th is seen as a disastrous
            error with unavoidable far-reaching repercussions. The US, and especially the Bush Administration, bears the
            main blame for this terrible conclusion. Notwithstanding the bleak picture, I’m still optimistic that a
            peaceful settlement may be reached before things get worse.</p>
